Apply antibiotic ointment: Use an antibiotic ointment to promote healing and prevent infections. Make sure to follow the product instructions. Protect the wound: Cover the wound with a clean bandage to protect it from friction, dirt, and bacteria. Change the bandage regularly. Avoid scratching: It may be tempting to scratch the affected area, but this can delay healing and increase the risk of infection. Try to keep the wound clean and protected. Take pain relievers: If the wound is painful, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, following the product instructions. Monitor for signs of infection: Keep an eye on the wound for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, excessive heat, pus, or persistent pain.

Apply for 15 to 20 minutes, then take a break before reapplying if necessary. Rest and elevation: Avoid overusing the bruised area. Elevate the affected body part as much as possible, especially during the first few hours after the injury. This helps reduce swelling. Compression: Use an elastic bandage to gently compress the bruised area. Make sure the bandage is not too tight to avoid restricting blood flow. Pain relievers: Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Follow the product instructions. Arnica: Some arnica-based products, a plant known for its anti-inflammatory properties, can be applied to the skin to help reduce bruises and swelling. Time: Bruises usually heal on their own over time. Be patient and allow your body to recover. Avoid heat: In the first few hours after the injury, avoid applying heat as it may increase swelling. After the first day, you can use warm compresses to improve blood circulation and relieve muscle tension. Consult a healthcare professional if necessary: If the bruise is very painful, accompanied by severe swelling, or if you have mobility issues, consult a doctor. X-rays may be necessary to rule out a fracture.");
